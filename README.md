# Digipres Hangman

It does what it says on the tin! Guess the digital preservation term one letter at a time.

Based on the [hangman code](https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/chapter7.html) by Al Sweigart.
Terms and hints are taken from [Digital Preservation for 5 Year Olds](https://github.com/Francesca4242/For_5_Year_Olds) by Francesca Mackenzie and Nathan Isip.
